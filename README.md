## Texture name format

The texture name in a zombie game consists of three parts:

* **Type** - defines the type of monster or object the texture is intended for.
* **Variant** - defines the variant of the texture, such as for different states of the monster or object.
* **Color** - defines the color of the texture.

Here is an example of a texture name:
